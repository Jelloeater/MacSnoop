#MacSnoop

* Just a simple app to track when devices come and go on a network

// TODO
* Eventually have an API w/ Flask-Restplus
* Store data in either SQLlite (win) or PostGREs? (docker)
* Have option to run in a docker container / cross platform
* Get deployed via CI/CD (why not ^_^)?
* It's gonna be sweet!
